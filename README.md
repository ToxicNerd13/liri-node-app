# liri-node-app

#### This app allows the user to input a search command and a keyword(s) to search for, which then sifts through various databases and returns relevant information. It runs in the command line using Javascript.

#### First the user must enter a command -- "concert-this," "spotify-this-song," "movie-this," or "do-what-it-says." For the first three commands, the following word or words the user enters will specify which artist/song/movie to search for. The LIRI app will then log relevant information to the console. In the case of "do-what-it-says," LIRI will choose a random command and run it with its own search parameters.

#### Technologies used in this app:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Axios package
* Dotenv package
* Spotify API package
* Moment package
